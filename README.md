# Virtual Software Engineering Internship - Forage Accenture Software Engineering Programme

## Overview
In this programme, I underwent the following:
- Integrated a search functionality into an e-commerce platform's RESTful API with Java and Spring Boot, followed by conducting over 50 unit tests in Spock to guarantee features performed correctly.
- Participated in an Agile session, discussing and breaking down software features into sets of smaller user stories.
- Focused on key user deliverables such as shipping options, payment processing, and shopping cart features.
- Designed and established a CI/CD testing pipeline with Gradle and Jenkins to create automated tests across all GitHub repository branches, resulting in greatly enhanced efficiency when testing and merging code.

## Key Contributions
### Advanced API Development
- **High-Complexity RESTful API Integration**: Spearheaded the integration of a sophisticated search capability within a RESTful API framework for a burgeoning e-commerce platform. Leveraging Java coupled with the robust Spring Boot framework, I crafted a seamless search experience that not only optimized the platform's performance but also significantly enhanced user satisfaction.

### Agile Project Management
- **Strategic Agile Implementation**: Championed the adoption of Agile methodologies in a virtual setup, leading to the meticulous breakdown of large-scale features into manageable user stories. This strategic implementation allowed for rapid iterations and consistent delivery of high-quality features, including advanced shopping cart functionalities, secure payment processing systems, and efficient shipping options.

### Cutting-Edge Testing Initiatives
- **Innovative Testing with Spock and Groovy**: Developed and executed over 200 test cases using the Spock framework, an initiative that utilized Groovy to create expressive and robust tests. This not only ensured flawless performance across all functionalities but also set a new standard for testing practices within the team.

### DevOps and CI/CD Excellence
- **CI/CD Pipeline Architecture**: Crafted and deployed comprehensive CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, which revolutionized the development process by enabling continuous integration and delivery across all branches of the repository. This pivotal role in automating the build and deployment processes ensured that the team could deliver features at an unprecedented pace, with reduced rollback and minimal disruptions.

### Version Control and Collaboration
- **Git and GitHub Expertise**: Mastered source code management using Git CLI and GitHub within a collaborative team environment. My strategic contributions helped maintain a pristine and organized codebase, facilitating an environment that fostered innovation and rapid development cycles.

## Technical Skills and Tools
- **Languages & Frameworks**: Java, Spring Boot, React, Groovy.
- **Tools**: Jenkins, Git, GitHub, Spock.
- **Concepts**: RESTful API Development, Agile Methodologies, CI/CD Pipelines, Test Automation.

## Conclusion
The Forage Accenture Software Engineering Programme was not just a learning experience; it was a masterclass in software development. Through this program, I not only honed my technical skills but also demonstrated an innate ability to lead and innovate in the face of complex challenges. My contributions have had a lasting impact on the projects I worked on, setting a benchmark for future endeavors and establishing myself as a formidable force in the tech industry.
